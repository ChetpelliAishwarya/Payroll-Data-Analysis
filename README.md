Payroll Intelligence Using Machine Learning
Project Overview:

This project focuses on building intelligence into payroll systems using Machine Learning. By combining data analysis and predictive modeling, it transforms traditional payroll from a record-keeping function into a data-driven decision support system. The solution delivers salary prediction, attrition risk analysis, payroll anomaly detection, and actionable HR insights.

Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to enhance payroll and HR management through Machine Learning by:
Predicting employee salaries based on experience and performance
Identifying employees at risk of attrition
Detecting payroll anomalies and inconsistencies
Generating business insights to support strategic HR decisions

Tools & Technologies

Python – Core programming language
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and pipelines
Jupyter Notebook – Analysis, experimentation, and reporting 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand payroll trends and workforce patterns, including:
Salary distribution analysis
Department-wise salary comparisons
Attendance and performance evaluation
Correlation analysis among key variables
Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used. All EDA results are documented in the Jupyter Notebook and exported as visual outputs.                                 

Feature Engineering

To add business intelligence and improve predictive power, the following features were engineered:
Salary per year of experience
Experience categories (Junior, Mid, Senior, Expert)
Performance categories
Low attendance and high leave flags
Attrition risk (target variable)

Machine Learning Models
1. Salary Prediction Model (Regression)

Algorithm: multiple linear regression
Key Features: Experience, attendance, leaves, performance, department
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE),R² Score

2.Attrition Prediction Model (Classification)

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Objective: Predict probability of employee attrition
Evaluation Metrics:Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

3.Anomaly Detection

Payroll anomalies were identified using:
Isolation Forest
This helps detect unusual salaries, excessive leave patterns, and abnormal attendance behavior, improving payroll accuracy and audit reliability.

Business Insights: What AI Adds to Payroll
Enables fair, consistent, and data-driven salary decisions
Predicts attrition risk for proactive HR interventions
Identifies productivity trends and top performers
Detects payroll anomalies and potential fraud
Supports strategic workforce planning and budgeting   

Key Outcomes:

Improved payroll transparency and accuracy
Early identification of attrition risks
Data-backed salary and compensation planning
Enhanced HR decision-making through AI
