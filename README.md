This project applies machine learning techniques to build intelligence into payroll systems using employee demographic, job, compensation, 
and satisfaction data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), salary prediction, employee attrition prediction, and anomaly detection 
for payroll errors or inconsistencies. End-to-end ML pipelines are implemented using Python and scikit-learn for robust preprocessing and modeling. 
The project demonstrates how AI-driven insights can improve payroll accuracy, workforce planning, and retention strategies.
